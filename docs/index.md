# Hands-On Learning

When this semester began, I was excited to do some more hands-on learning and practicing with specific digital tools. I've worked with python in the past in undergrad, and I've always enjoyed tinkering with tech and software, but I have also always felt myself limited by what I didn't know. I still do, after this semester, but to a far lesser extent. 

I feel like I can push myself a bit more. case in point, I can make a markdown site, and an HTML page with a resume, and I can even start tinkering with DITA. All of these tools will prove useful in my personal and professional life with technology. 

# Potential for Growth 

We've covered a lot this term: 

- **DITA**
- **HTML and CSS**
- **Markdown** 
- **Git and Github**
- **Writing digitally for clients**
- **Collaborating with digital tech**

I want to dive deeper into DITA especially moving forward. I've written on this before this semester, but I can see real use cases for that even in my rather low-level office, so I think more practice and familiarity could only be a good thing. Fir one of my two artifacts, I've worked a bit more on my first DITA project, and I have it linked on the other page linked above. 

HTML and CSS are things I want to learn more on as well. My second artifact is the personal site I have linked on the other page there, built with HTML and CSS. That is something I want to refine and work more on moving forward as a way to showcase myself better to employers. It's not a lot right now, but I'm happy with how it looks--I'll confess to having emulated a couple different code templates, though. Like I said, there's more to learn. But knowing how to use Github to platform and workshop development projects like these opens up a whole world of possibility. So I see room for me to expand on what we've gleaned of these 'hard' skills. 

And we've studied 'soft' skills, too. We've taken a lot of long looks at what it means to write digitally, and what the current media environment means for us as technical communicators. Catering to clients, for instance, demands a lot of attention to not only what they want, but what our tools and skillsets can offer them. And to circle back to Github for a second, we've also learned about how to collaborate more effectively with peers on these kinds of digital writing projects. 

#Parting Thoughts

Like I wrote above, I feel like I have a deeper appreciation for what it means to develop digital content. Moreover, I think I better understand that I *like* to do this sort of work. I want to improve my skills in this area, and I feel more equipped to put the work in to make that improvement a reality.
